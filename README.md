# ML-Adopt-a-Buddy

## Problem Statement
> The brighter side of the pandemic is an increase in animal adoption and fostering. To ensure that their customers stay indoors, a leading pet adoption agency plans on creating a virtual-tour experience, showcasing all animals available in their shelter. To enable that, you have been tasked to build a Machine Learning model that determines type and breed of the animal based on its physical attributes and other factors.

## Dataset
> The dataset consists of parameters such as: a unique ID assigned to each animal that is up for adoption, date on which they arrived at the shelter, their physical attributes such as color, length and height, among other factors.

## Approach
> We have to find the pet category and the breed category so it is a problem of multilabel classification. I have used the approach of KNN nearest neighbours and got an approximate of 56 % as accuracy
